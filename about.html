    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
        We can do car service, we lend cars at a fee, or have them bought with insurance and also 
        allow our customers to sell to us their used cars.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have been in this line of work since 1975 and our profits have improved over the years
        and in this present decade, by a big margin.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are grateful to our supporters, our stakeholders and shareholders, our customers, our 
        employees and the board of management for the continued moral support and the cash inflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the community in my control and trust, we pledge to always make the customers happy and
        satisfied with our products and services and provide help/assistance to the troubles of our system.
    </p>
