        <p>
        About the copyright issues, there are two solutions to the current dilemma you'll be in 
        if you do not comply, and that is:
        </p>
        <p>  1.] You will have to accept, without argument, that half of your earnings are now going to us.</p>
    
        <p>  2.] All your assets or at least 50% of your assets will now belong to us.</p>
    
        <p>
        That is if you want to keep quiet about it.
        However, if you decide to go to court, we have documents signed by the judge and the governor,
        that says;
        </p>
        <p>     
        "TO ANYONE WHO IS GUILTY OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES, A FINE OF 10 MILLION DOLLARS IS TO BE GIVEN
        BACK TO THE COMPANY WHICH IS THE VICTIM HERE, THAT IS [STAN'S CAR ENTREPRISES]"
        BE CAUTIOUS!!!
